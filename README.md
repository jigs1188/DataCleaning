## Overview
The goal of this project is to showcase data cleaning techniques, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats. The cleaned data can be used for further analysis and visualization.

## Features
- Load and inspect data
- Handle missing values
- Remove duplicate records
- Standardize data formats
- Save cleaned data

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/netflix-data-cleaning.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd netflix-data-cleaning
    ```
3. Install the required libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy
    ```

## Usage
1. Download the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ariyoomotade/netflix-data-cleaning-analysis-and-visualization/data) and place the `netflix_titles.csv` file in the project directory.
2. Run the data cleaning script:
    ```bash
    python netflix_data_cleaning.py
    ```
3. The cleaned data will be saved to `cleaned_netflix_titles.csv`.

## Data Cleaning Steps
1. **Load the data**: Read the CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Inspect the data**: Display basic information and statistics about the dataset.
3. **Handle missing values**: Fill or remove missing values appropriately.
4. **Remove duplicates**: Eliminate duplicate rows.
5. **Standardize data formats**: Ensure consistency in data formats, such as date and text case.
6. **Save the cleaned data**: Write the cleaned DataFrame to a new CSV file.

## Results
The cleaned dataset is saved as `cleaned_netflix_titles.csv`, which is ready for further analysis and visualization.

## Next Steps
- Add unit tests to validate the data cleaning functions.
- Create visualizations to analyze the cleaned dataset.
